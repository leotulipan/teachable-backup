# plan to improve the queuing and downloading system

while still adhering to your concurrency design goals

1. **Separate Metadata Fetching From Downloading**  
   - Maintain two distinct workflows:  
     1. Gathering course metadata (sections, lectures, attachments).  
     2. Scheduling downloads for attachments.  
   - Immediately queue attachments for download as soon as they’re discovered, rather than waiting for all metadata to finish. This way, large files can start downloading sooner.

2. **Centralized Download Manager**  
   - Create a central download manager component that:  
     - Stores a queue of download tasks.  
     - Uses one `asyncio.Semaphore` shared across all courses for controlling the overall concurrency.  
     - Can process large file downloads in parallel, up to `MAX_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS`.  

3. **Producer/Consumer Flow**  
   - Implement a producer flow (collecting metadata and creating download tasks) and a consumer flow (executing downloads).  
   - Each new attachment discovered is “produced” as a task and added to the queue.  
   - A consumer workflow removes tasks from the queue and executes them up to the concurrency limit.

4. **Early Returns for Invalid or Already-Existing Files**  
   - Keep the existing logic for skipping files that already match the expected size or exist entirely. This reduces unnecessary concurrency overhead and can focus on missing/partial files.  

5. **Graceful Shutdown and Cleanup**  
   - In case of cancellation or errors, ensure running downloads can complete or clean up partial files properly.  
   - If metadata has been retrieved for multiple courses and a user stops the process, provide an option to resume or to remove partial files.
   - make sure the script can be interrupted by CTRL-C and the last partial file is renamed withg .partial at the end
